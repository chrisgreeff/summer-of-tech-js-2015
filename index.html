                    <p>Hello!</p>

                    <aside class="notes">Hey guys! I'm Chris, and this is Sarah, and we work for an awesome company called Vend! If you haven't heard of them, they're a small company based in New Market who build software to help retailers run and manage their businesses</aside>

                        <aside class="notes">Heres a photo of the New Zealand team at our last Christmas party. Oh and to prove that we do actually work there, here's me and here's Sarah.</aside>

                    <section>
                        <aside class="notes">So aside from part time modeling, me and Sarah spend our days working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, helping Vend build beautiful web applications that retailers love to use. So we've been asked to give you guys an overview about this one, so I thought the best place to start would be the beginning</aside>

                        <p>Add Net scape images</p>

                        <aside class="notes">JavaScript first appeared in 1995 with the release of NetScape 2. Back when browsers used to looks like this. Any of you guys remember when your browsers looked like this? Were any of you alive? I can still remember clearly, the whole family crowding around the computer, and being amazed at how fast the progress bar at the bottom used to move.</aside>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            Anyway, so first appeared in 1995. Anyone want to hazard a guess as to how long it took to implement? Here's a bit of help. JavaScript took 10 days to complete.

                    <section>
                        <aside class="notes">As a result of being a language that was written in such a ridiculously short amount of time, JavaScript is probably the most misunderstood mainstream languages in the world. Why? Well lets take a look at the language itself!</aside>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Language</h2>

                    <aside class="notes">Now before I start, are there any here that has some JavaScript experience? If you have, you probably know some if this already, so I'd ask you, if you know the answers to give the others here a fighting chance.</aside>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Loosely Typed</h2>

                        <aside class="notes">JavaScript is a loosely typed language, so unlike Java or C, you don't have to be explicit in the type of variable you are declaring. You can just use the keyword `var`, and JavaScript will work out what you're talking about.</aside>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Types</h2>

                        <aside class="notes">So like any language there are a number of different types in JavaScript. You're probably familiar with most of these, except for maybe NaN and undefined. I won't go through all of these in detail, but just to give you a quick overview if you aren't already familiar</aside>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Objects</h2>

                        <aside class="notes">To keep things simple, you can think of objects as basic maps of key value pairs. So for example defining myObj, with a property called. Interacting with the property is done through the dot notation</aside>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>NaN</h2>

                        <aside class="notes">As a quick intro to these concepts, NaN is a mathematical concept in which rather than throwing an error when an impossible mathematical operation is performed, the result NaN is returned. So for example 2/'derp' will give the result NaN.</aside>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Undefined</h2>

                        <aside class="notes">Undefined is a little simpler to understand. It's basically any declared variable or object property that has not been assigned a value by default gets the value undefined.</aside>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Functions</h2>

                        <aside class="notes">Like other language JavaScript also has the concept of functions, which you can define using the `function` keyword, and invoke with parameters using brackets.</aside>

                        <aside class="notes">However with all of these little quirks of the language, it hasn't prevented JavaScript from becoming, by far, one of the most widely used languages in the world (and also the most awesome!). I'll let Sarah tell you why.</aside>
