                        <p>This was super fun and also quite a challenging project for me, throwing hardware into the mix
There are lots more factors to consider when debugging,
It might not be the line of code you changed that stopped it working, it could just be out of battery
you also have to wait for your stuff to be delivered rather than just npm install

I like challenging myself so I got pretty interested in this whole JavaScript hardware space and carrying on from shubot i soon…

                        <p>shake to connect to bluetooth
bluetooth is a real pain actually which is one of the reasons i’m showing you a vid instead of live

It uses music data from the audio element to create a bit of a boggie
I added song changes via leap motion to spice it up a bit

i pause it a couple times to show: when there’s no music data being received the sphero just stops

Usually Cylon is run via the command line, but you can also run it through the browser which is cool.

For this program I actually use a full on chrome app instead of a straight web page, in order to allow connections via bluetooth

Boogie bot was really fun and i became really enthralled by this audio reactive visuals idea using the web audio API

                        <p>This is something I am currently looking into, so I’ll show you a mix of my most favourite projects that I am drawing inspiration from

To start this is a really cool visualisation of the data you get access to via the analyser node

Created by felixturner who has actually created lots of my favourite projects

Waveform – the jagged white line, it’s the shape of the sound wave as it flies through the air and hits your ear.

Levels – the bar chart of frequency amplitudes, from bass on the left to treble on the right.

Volume – the thicker bar on the right hand side

Beat Detection – the volume bar flashes white when a beat is detected. The white line above the volume bar indicates the beat threshold.

The potential from that data to create sweet visuals is crazy</p>

                        <p>One way is via hardware like I did with boogie bot
Another way is through the use of Web GL
This is another one of felix’s projects using web gl and web audio called word problems

It absolutely amazes me that this is all done via javascript, how exciting is that?!

So this is a project created by barkek d for a party
They were projected on a wall and guests could interact with them using a Leap Motion device while not even putting down their drink

All the code for it is open source which is aaahmazing</p>

This is another favourite of mine that I recently found, also using WebGL

There’s quite a bit of cool stuff out there but this is actually another one by felix

                        <p>From the 3D stuff with Web GL, I also re-discovered all the rad stuff you can do with canvas

This library sketch.js is really cool created by Justin or @soulwire on twitter

He has created a bunch of sweet sweet animations

The one named particles became very useful to me recently

                        <p>At Vend, we have a keg and a common problem with the keg is we don’t really track when it’s finished, which has left a couple of Fridays pretty dry. And as web developers this is unacceptable

So a few of us got together to hack on beerbot.

A flowmeter is attached to the keg, and via an API you can receive data about how much is left, what beer is in there currently, what’s coming next, the temperature of the beer
All very important facts

The designs are by our very own VendHQ popmaker Jacky Lee

Him, Lance, Raf and Jamie have done most of the handwork and my contribution was

                        <p>BUBBLES

DEMO ( http://beerbot.sys.vendhq.com )

It’s all live and my bubble module is up on github if you want to check it out. Definitely inspired by soul wire’s particles as well as another bubble canvas example i found on codepen

I am still working on making the bubble physics a bit more accurate
And I’m thinking of extending into water bubbles and sounds and things haha

To beerbot we are also going to add things like slopping the liquid around when you’re on an IPad and tilting it, things like that

What is more fun than bubbles!

That’s all that I have in progress right now, pretty excited to keep tinkering with the audio visual stuff for sure
