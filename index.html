                            <p>Working at Vend our engineers also get the chance to travel the world attending conferences &amp; events like these in different cities</p>
                            <p>Last year Chris attended JSConf in Berlin and bought a ton of interesting information &amp; inspiration back to the team.</p>
                            <p>And I presented at FullStack in London &amp; attended XOXO festival in Portland, Oregon. Where I met a ton of industry leaders who I talked to about Vend &amp; code &amp; it was amazing.</p>
                            <p>To be a high performing team of engineers, we believe it's important to be out there getting involved, sharing &amp; learning from each other</p>
                            <p>Start in your own city and on the web. And then you can expand to the world</p>

                            <p>Another tool we use heavily in our community is Github. I hope you are all familiar with this and Git version control.</p>

                            <p>If you haven't got your own GitHub account, I recommend one outcome from today to be to go and create one.<p>
                            <p>Artists have sketchbooks. As developers, this is our version.</p>
                            <p>Any little idea you have, tinker with it a bit, push it up, let others check it out, come back to it later, it might go somewhere.</p>

                            <p>This is my GitHub account.</p>
                            <p>I have a few projects up there. I definitely want to add more and make more time to do open source development.</p>
                            <p>It took me a while to start getting involved this way. But the benefits of it I can't emphasise enough.</p>

                            <p>This was super fun but also quite a challenging project for me, throwing hardware into the mix</p>
                            <p>There are lots more factors to consider when debugging, that you don't have to worry about with software.</p>
                            <p>It might not be the line of code you changed that stopped it working, it could just be out of battery</p>
                            <p>I like challenging myself so I got pretty interested in this whole JavaScript hardware space and carrying on from Shubot I soon…</p>

                            <p>bluetooth is a real pain actually which is one of the reasons i’m showing you a vid instead of live</p>
                            <p>It uses music data from the audio element to create a bit of a boggie</p>
                            <p>I added song changes via leap motion to spice it up a bit</p>
                            <p>i pause it a couple times to show: when there’s no music data being received the sphero just stops</p>
                            <p>Usually Cylon is run via the command line, but you can also run it through the browser which is cool.</p>
                            <p>For this program I actually use a full on chrome app instead of a straight web page, in order to allow connections via bluetooth</p>
                            <p>Boogie bot was really fun and i became really enthralled by this audio reactive visuals idea using the web audio API</p>

                            <p>This is something I am currently looking into, so I’ll show you a mix of my most favourite projects that I am drawing inspiration from</p>
                            <p>To start this is a really cool visualisation of the data you get access to via the analyser node</p>
                            <p>Created by @felixturner who has actually created lots of my favourite projects</p>

                            <p>Waveform - the jagged white line, it's the shape of the sound wave as it flies through the air and hits your ear.</p>
                            <p>Levels - the bar chart of frequency amplitudes, from bass on the left to treble on the right.</p>
                            <p>Volume - the thicker bar on the right hand side</p>
                            <p>Beat Detection - the volume bar flashes white when a beat is detected. The white line above the volume bar indicates the beat threshold.</p>

                            <p>The potential from that data to create sweet visuals is crazy</p>

                            <p>Another way is through the use of Web GL.</p>
                            <p>Which is a technology for creating 3D graphics on the web. If you have done any C++ programming and heard of Open GL it's the same kind of thing.</p>
                            <p>This is another one of felix’s projects using web gl and web audio called word problems</p>

                            <p>At Vend, we have a keg and a common problem with the keg is we don’t really track when it’s finished, which has left a couple of Fridays pretty dry. And as web developers this is unacceptable</p>
                            <p>So a few of us got together to hack on beerbot.</p>
                            <p>A flowmeter is attached to the keg, and via an API you can receive data about how much is left, what beer is in there currently, what’s coming next, the temperature of the beer</p>

                            <p>DEMO ( http://beerbot.sys.vendhq.com )</p>
                            <p>It’s all live and my bubble module is up on my GitHub account if you want to check it out. Definitely inspired by @soulwire’s particles as well as another bubble canvas example I found on codepen.</p>
                            <p>Another cool code sharing tool that will be in the resources at the end.</p>
                            <p>I am still working on making the bubble physics a bit more accurate</p>
                            <p>And I’m thinking of extending into water bubbles and sounds and things haha</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>To beerbot we are also going to add things like slopping the liquid around when you’re on an IPad and tilting it, things like that</p>

                        <p>One, it's awesome. And two, the story behind why Josh made it is rad.</p>
                        <p>He was struggling to answer his 5 year old daughters questions about space and how far things are.</p>
                        <p>Metaphors about golf balls and elephants wasn't really cutting it</p>
                        <p>So he thought to use the canvas of the web, pixels!</p>
                        <p>Totally great! And now an awesome resource for all of us too</p>
                        <p>As one last example of something useful, cool and made with JavaScript!....</p>

                            <p>I briefly touched on what the meaning of open source is</p>
                            <p>And I mentioned you should create and share your projects to build up a portfolio of things to show off for future employers and what not. I just wanted to emphasise it again here.</p>
                            <p>In the industry, code is important &amp; a large part of it. There's also SO much more.</p>
