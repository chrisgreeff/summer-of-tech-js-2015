                    <aside>I started at Vend when we were quite small, just starting out

I've been part of our growth from 20 people chatting in a room just under 3 years ago, to a company that is now 6 offices around the world totaling about 250 people...

Within our Product &amp; Engineering team (which is where I am) that growth has been from about 11 when I started to about 70 now. Most of us are here in Auckland, and 5 are in our new Wellington office

Almost 3 years of crazy awesomeness as well as crazy hard work.

We use pretty neat tech and paired with our culture, people, team stuff and everything that goes on - it is a pretty exciting place to be everyday

We've got heaps of new things coming out this year actually that I'm super stoked about showing off

This version is in beta at the moment which is exciting  If any of you have worked in retail you are probably familiar with POS !

As customers when you go into a store, pick an item, have it scanned, discounted, and what not &amp; then you pay for it, that's what you're dealing with
